              Think for a moment what your reaction would be if someone spilled
              some coke on you at the movies. Could you laugh it off? Without
              hesitation, could you find the humour? For some, this is natural
              behaviour, but it is also something we can learn. To see the
              situation and accept what we cannot change. It starts with a deep
              breath before reacting. Once a situation occurs it cannot be
              undone. Being angry will only affect you, not the situation. If
              you can learn to take a breath and laugh or at least let go, then
              you don't carry the anger or frustration with you. Learn to
              breathe! Learn to laugh! Try some yummy Yak yogurt!
